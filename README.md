### ðŸš§WIP: Work in progress! It is not usable yet

### What & Why

This little tool helps you build web app with `Reason` and `React` with just one command.
I know that for some of you it might seems little overkill, beacuse you just install bs-platform, parcel, reason-react and you are go to go.

But when I was starting with react, create-react-app was very helpful so I made this tool to make starting with reason even simpler.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm compile` or `yarn compile`

This will run `bsb -w -make-world`, which compiles all your reason code. You can change some of the compilation settings in `bsconfig.json`, you can learn about this config more, on official bs-platfom documentation check this [link](https://bucklescript.github.io/docs/en/build-configuration#docsNav). But for now you are good to go ðŸ˜‰

<!-- ## Learn More
